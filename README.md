DNA replication is a fundamental process in cellular biology, crucial for maintaining genetic integrity across cellgenerations. A comprehensive understanding of DNA replication mechanisms is vital for insights into cancer and othergenomic instability disorders. In this review, we examine problem statements derived from recent literature, describemethodologies to address these problems using computational methods, and discuss the results, including graphicalanalyses generated from these approaches. Our findings contribute to a lucid understanding of DNA replication dynamicsin eukaryotic cells.
